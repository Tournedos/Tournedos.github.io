  What defines a Battle Royale game?
</h2>

In this project, we define Battle Royale (BR) games as a specific subgenre of online multiplayer games where a large number of players compete in the same match with a single objective: be the last player (or team) alive. Although implementations differ from game to game, most Battle Royale titles share a common set of mechanics:

</figure>

From a content perspective, these characteristics make Battle Royale games extremely YouTube-friendly:  
they naturally generate clutch moments, comebacks, chaotic endgames, and highlight-worthy plays, which are ideal for short-form clips, montages, and high-intensity streams.

  A short historical background of the Battle Royale genre
</h2>

The idea behind Battle Royale in games predates the genre label itself. On the fiction side, many authors and films explored “last-person-standing” death games. A clear reference point in game journalism is Koushun Takami’s 1999 novel Battle Royale and its 2000 film adaptation, in which a group of students is forced to fight until only one survives. Several game journalists explicitly link the structure of modern Battle Royale games to this story template.

On the game design side, the genre evolved from mods for survival and sandbox games in the early 2010s. Key early experiments included:

- Community “Hunger Games” / Survival Games plugins for Minecraft around 2012.
- DayZ and later Arma 2 / Arma 3 survival mods.
- Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene’s Battle Royale mods, introducing large lobbies, random loot, and a shrinking safe zone on military-style maps.
- H1Z1: King of the Kill (2015), one of the first standalone shooters built fully around this format.

The modern Battle Royale “boom” occurred in the mid-to-late 2010s, with widely recognized milestones:

- 2017 — PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) brings the mod formula to a commercial Steam release, popularizing the now-standard loop: ~100 players drop from a plane, loot, and fight inside a shrinking circle.
- 2017 — Fortnite Battle Royale launches as a free mode, quickly reaching a wider audience than PUBG, helped by its accessibility, building mechanics, and cross-platform support.
- 2019–2020 — pex Legends and Call of Duty: Warzone integrate Battle Royale into large existing franchises, attracting tens of millions of players within weeks, confirming BR as a mainstream competitive format.

In this project, we focus on the modern wave of Battle Royale titles (from H1Z1, PUBG, and Fortnite onwards) and study how their rise reshaped YouTube gaming content.

    0.3 Project guidelines and research questions
</h2>

Our goal is to tell a structured, data-driven story about how Battle Royale (BR) games enter and reshape YouTube gaming.
To do this, we organize the project into five main steps, each with its own guiding questions:

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">

<h2 style="color:#003c9e; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:900 !important;">
    Pre-BR context - What did YouTube gaming look like before Battle Royale?
</h2>

Which game genres dominate YouTube before BR appears (FPS, MOBA, Sports, Sandbox, Single Player / Open World, etc.)?

What are the “codes” of each genre:
- who are the most visible creators,
- what are the typical video formats (highlights, long-form let's plays, competitive matches, commentary, etc.)?


<h2 style="color:#003c9e; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:900 !important;">
    Arrival of Battle Royale – When, who, and how does BR arrive on YouTube?
</h2>

At what point do BR videos start to appear in non-negligible volume?

Is the rise of BR content sudden (a sharp takeoff) or gradual over several months/years?

Does BR content appear immediately at game launch, or is there a specific event (patch, tournament, creator hype, cultural moment) that triggers the explosion?


<h2 style="color:#003c9e; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:900 !important;">
    Impact of BR – How do existing genres and creators react ?
</h2>

Which genres are most affected by the rise of BR (e.g., classic FPS, Sandbox, Sports)?

Do these genres change:
- their video formats (length, structure, titles, thumbnails),
- their upload frequency,
- their view counts and relative share of attention?

At the individual channel level:
- which creators start uploading BR content,
- do they add BR on top of their usual content or replace their previous main genre,
- do their audiences seem to shift from non-BR videos to BR videos?


<h2 style="color:#003c9e; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:900 !important;">
    Long-term effects – Is BR a temporary shock or a lasting transformation ?
</h2>


Do other genres “recover” after the BR wave, or do they remain structurally smaller than before?

How does their growth before BR compare to their growth after BR?

When some genres adopt new formats in response to BR (e.g., shorter highlight-style videos), do these changes persist in the long run, or do formats drift back to their original codes?

For Battle Royale itself:
- does BR content keep growing, stabilize, or decline by the end of the YouNiverse period?
- is BR best described as a short-lived trend or as a structural shift in YouTube gaming?

<h2 style="color:#003c9e; font-size:2rem; font-weight:900 !important;">
    Conclusion and outlook
</h2>

How can we summarize the role of Battle Royale in the broader evolution of YouTube gaming?

How do later titles (e.g., Warzone and other post-YouNiverse BR releases) fit into the patterns we observe, and what do they suggest about the future of “genre shocks” on content platforms?

In the rest of the project, each section will tackle one of these steps, combining genre-level dynamics (shares, volumes, timelines) with creator-level behavior (who adopts BR, how, and with what impact).

    0.4 Selecting our game panel from Twitch
</h2>

To decide which games actually matter in our analysis, we start from Twitch rather than YouTube. We use the public Kaggle dataset “Top games on Twitch 2016–2023” by Kartik Kirsh, which lists the monthly top 200 games on Twitch together with hours watched, hours streamed and average viewers [Twitch Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rankirsh/evolution-of-top-games-on-twitch).

From this dataset we build our game panel in four main steps:

<h2 style="color:#003c9e; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:900 !important;">
    Time window and cleaning
</h2>

- We keep only the years 2016–2019, which cover the main rise of modern Battle Royale titles.  
- We drop non-game categories (e.g. Just Chatting, Special Events, Creative, Poker), so that we only track actual video games.

<h2 style="color:#003c9e; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:900 !important;">
    Aggregate popularity per licence
</h2>

- For each game, we sum hours watched over all months in 2016–2019.  
- We then merge yearly releases into a single licence (e.g. all FIFA entries → FIFA, all Call of Duty entries → Call of Duty) and recompute total hours watched per licence.

<h2 style="color:#003c9e; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:900 !important;">
    Top–50 core panel
</h2>

- We rank licences by total hours watched and keep the top 50.  
- These 50 licences form our core panel of games that actually structure Twitch viewership during the Battle Royale era.

<h2 style="color:#003c9e; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:900 !important;">
    Manual genre annotation
</h2>

- Each licence is manually mapped to one of our high-level genres:  
  Battle Royale, FPS, MOBA, Sports, Sandbox, MMORPG, Strategy, Single Player / Open World, Nintendo, Card / CCG, Fighting, Horror.  
- The result is stored in `data/filtered/twitch/games_selected.csv`.

Within this panel, licences annotated as Battle Royale (e.g. H1Z1 / Z1: Battle Royale, PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS, Fortnite, Apex Legends) form our BR game set, which we will later try to trace on YouTube using genre classification.

**Which games dominate Twitch in our panel?**

- **League of Legends** is the clear #1.
- **Fortnite**, **Dota 2**, **CS:GO** form the next dominance tier → MOBAs + FPS remain the structural core of Twitch (2016–2019).
- **Battle Royale is central**:  
  - **Fortnite** ranks #2 overall.  
  - **PUBG** sits in the top tier next to long-standing giants like **Hearthstone**, **Overwatch**, **World of Warcraft**.

- **Enduring esports staples** (Rocket League, Smash, Rainbow Six Siege) keep strong, persistent positions.
- **Sports franchises** (FIFA, NBA 2K) appear regularly due to yearly releases and competitive cycles.
- **Sandbox / open-world powerhouses** (Minecraft, GTA V, ARK, DayZ, RDR2) maintain high watch time thanks to creator versatility and persistent gameplay loops.

**Conclusion:**  
The panel captures Twitch’s structural pillars (MOBAs, FPS, evergreen sandboxes, major esports) while also showing how **Battle Royale rapidly reached top-tier attention**, rivaling long-established titles.
