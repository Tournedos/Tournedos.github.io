## Evolution of Gaming Content

Gaming videos are one of YouTube’s biggest categories. This project tracks how gaming content evolved between 2005 and 2019 by combining channel-level growth with video-level metadata. Using titles and tags, we can identify popular games and compare the rise and decline of sub-genres like:

- Sandbox (Minecraft)  
- MOBAs (League of Legends)  
- Shooters  
- Mobile games  

We can also examine whether YouTube gaming popularity reflects “real” game success by comparing with external statistics on game sales or player counts. Another angle is to compare engagement across platforms: do PC and console games exhibit similar popularity trends on YouTube over time? Finally, we study the influence of Twitch (launched 2011, prospering from 2014): did YouTube gaming channels lose popularity as live streaming drew viewers away?  

This project reveals both cultural shifts in gaming and the impact of platform competition on content creation.

## The Emergence of Scrollable Content

The late 2010s saw the rapid rise of competitors such as TikTok and Instagram video, reshaping online content consumption. This project asks: did YouTube engagement decline in parallel with the emergence of these new platforms, and if so, which content fields were most affected?  

We examine whether categories such as short entertainment clips (e.g., fails, memes) lost engagement faster than more resilient formats like long podcasts or complex tutorials. The approach analyzes:

- Video-level metadata (view counts, likes, upload frequency)  
- Channel-level time series (subscriber growth) between 2017–2019  

This period coincides with the acceleration of TikTok and Instagram video. Trends are compared across content categories, controlling for channel age and size. Importantly, the phenomenon must have been detectable on YouTube itself, as the platform eventually launched **YouTube Shorts** in response to short-form competitors.  

The results clarify whether YouTube became a hub for long-form, niche, or professionalized content, while lighter entertainment migrated elsewhere.
