## 0.1 What is a Battle Royale game?

In this project, we define **Battle Royale (BR) games** as a specific subgenre of online multiplayer games where a large number of players compete in the same match with a single objective: **be the last player (or team) alive**.

Although implementations differ from game to game, most Battle Royale titles share a common set of mechanics:

### Large-scale matches
Typically between **50 and 150 players** spawn into the same map and compete in a single shared match.

### Minimal starting equipment
Players usually start with **little or no gear** and must loot weapons, armor, and resources directly in the game world.

### Shrinking safe zone
A circular “**safe zone**” progressively shrinks over time. Players outside this zone take damage, forcing everyone into **closer encounters**.

### Permanent elimination
Once a player (or squad) is eliminated, they **do not respawn** in the same match. Every fight can therefore be decisive.

### High variability between matches
The combination of **random loot**, different drop locations, and changing safe zones creates **high variability** from one game to another.

From a content perspective, these characteristics make Battle Royale games extremely **YouTube-friendly**:  
they naturally generate **clutch moments, comebacks, chaotic endgames**, and **highlight-worthy plays**, which are ideal for **short-form clips, montages**, and **high-intensity streams**.

## 0.2 A short historical background of the Battle Royale genre

The idea behind **Battle Royale** in games predates the genre label itself. On the fiction side, many authors and films explored “last-person-standing” death games. A clear reference point in game journalism is **Koushun Takami’s 1999 novel *Battle Royale*** and its 2000 film adaptation, in which a group of students is forced to fight until only one survives. Several game journalists explicitly link the structure of modern Battle Royale games to this story template.

On the game design side, the genre evolved from **mods for survival and sandbox games** in the early 2010s. Key early experiments included:

- Community “Hunger Games” / Survival Games plugins for **Minecraft** around 2012.
- **DayZ** and later **Arma 2 / Arma 3 survival mods**.
- Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene’s **Battle Royale mods**, introducing **large lobbies, random loot, and a shrinking safe zone** on military-style maps.
- **H1Z1: King of the Kill** (2015), one of the first standalone shooters built fully around this format.

The modern Battle Royale “boom” occurred in the **mid-to-late 2010s**, with widely recognized milestones:

- **2017** — *PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG)* brings the mod formula to a commercial Steam release, popularizing the now-standard loop: ~100 players drop from a plane, loot, and fight inside a shrinking circle.
- **2017** — *Fortnite Battle Royale* launches as a free mode, quickly reaching a wider audience than PUBG, helped by its **accessibility, building mechanics, and cross-platform support**.
- **2019–2020** — *Apex Legends* and *Call of Duty: Warzone* integrate Battle Royale into large existing franchises, attracting tens of millions of players within weeks, confirming BR as a **mainstream competitive format**.

In this project, we focus on the modern wave of Battle Royale titles (from **H1Z1, PUBG, and Fortnite onwards**) and study how their rise **reshaped YouTube gaming content**.
