Battle Royale’s rise on YouTube reshaped the gaming ecosystem without hollowing it out.

Act 1 – Content: Uploads and views for BR content surged after 2017, quickly surpassing most established genres and accounting for roughly a quarter of all gaming uploads by 2019. This growth coincided with an overall increase in gaming activity, suggesting a rising tide rather than zero‑sum competition. BR’s success rotated among a few flagship titles, none dominating for long.

Act 2 – Creators: Tracking channel movements between genres showed that BR was nearly absent before 2017 but became a dominant destination during the Fortnite boom. Most BR creators came from FPS, Sandbox, and Sports, yet inflows did not depress other genres. While BR phases gave channels a growth boost, creators did not post more frequently or stay permanently, many tried BR, gained an audience surge, but few made it a long-term home.

Act 3 – Viewers: BR attracted new audiences, with ~15 % of active commenters entering via BR videos. Retention was strong—over 80 % of BR starters stayed engaged, compared to up to 40 % leaving traditional genres. BR also drove higher engagement, with more likes per view and longer watch sessions.

Together, these patterns show BR as a catalyst: sparking growth in content, creators, and audiences without cannibalizing existing genres. Its appeal lay in engagement and novelty rather than sheer output or permanence. After the initial boom, BR settled alongside other genres, expanding YouTube’s gaming boundaries.
