Battle Royale’s meteoric rise on YouTube was a multi‑faceted phenomenon that altered the platform’s ecosystem without hollowing it out. 

In Act 1 we saw that uploads and views for BR content surged after 2017, rapidly overtaking most established genres and reaching roughly a quarter of all gaming uploads by 2019. This expansion was not isolated: aggregate gaming activity grew alongside BR, suggesting a rising tide rather than a zero‑sum reallocation. BR’s success was driven by a few flagship titles that rotated in prominence across the boom, but no single game dominated for long.

Act 2 shifted the lens from content to creators. By identifying rolling genre phases, we tracked how channels moved between genres and whether BR siphoned off creators from elsewhere. The transition heatmaps showed that BR was nearly absent before 2017 and then became the dominant destination, especially during the Fortnite boom. Direct inflows revealed that FPS, Sandbox and Sports supplied most BR creators, yet correlation analyses demonstrated that BR inflows did not depress inflows into those genres. These patterns point to diversification, not substitution. At the channel level, BR phases delivered a clear growth advantage, but creators did not upload more frequently nor stay longer in BR than in other genres, and their output per subscriber was no higher. Many creators tried BR and benefited from its audience surge, but few made it a permanent home.

The final section extended the analysis to viewers, confirming that BR’s boom was more than a spike in content production. BR acted as a gateway for new audiences: around 15 % of active commenters entering the ecosystem during the boom arrived via BR videos. Retention metrics showed a “hook” effect—over 80 % of viewers who started with BR remained engaged with the genre, whereas traditional categories like FPS lost up to 40 % of their commenters to BR over time. Engagement quality was also higher: BR videos attracted a significantly higher likes‑per‑view ratio and sustained longer view sessions. These results indicate that BR didn’t just amplify existing consumption; it transformed viewer behaviour, drawing in younger and more interactive audiences while elevating overall engagement.

Taken together, these findings paint Battle Royale as a catalyst in the YouTube gaming ecosystem: it spurred rapid growth in content, creators and viewers without cannibalising established genres. Its appeal lay in high engagement and community novelty rather than sheer output or creator persistence. As the initial boom waned, BR settled into the landscape alongside other genres, having permanently expanded the platform’s boundaries. Future disruptive genres may follow a similar path—igniting a wave of experimentation and attracting new users before blending back into a more diverse equilibrium.
