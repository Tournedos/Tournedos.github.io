Now that we have analyzed how the emergence of Battle Royale impacted the gaming ecosystem of YouTube and how the creators of content reacted, we're going to focus on what happened at the viewers level. The goal is to observe whether Battle Royale genre stole aucience from other genres, or even if commenters migrated from other gaming communitites to the Battle Royale genre. In addition to that, we can ask whether the engagement dynamic of the Battle Royale community differs from other genres, and which factors influence this shift in which type of content the viewers want to consumme. In addition, it will be interesting to see if the communities of the Battle Royale games show different behaviors compared to the other genres, like more positivity/happy or more toxicity/hate.

Now we're going to focus on whether the engagement dynamics differ for Battle Royale content. More specifically, the goal is to analyze whether the new communities and the people that have started to consumme this type of content showed more engagement, or maybe less, for the videos. This can be performed by analyzing several factors as the ratio of likes per views (LPV). This ratio could indicate how implicated are the people who watch the videos. We can think of that because the viewers, that only watch the videos without liking it, could be thought to be less passionate by the content than the ones who like the videos all the time.

</h2>
Now that we have observed that the viewers were more enthusiastic for Battle Royal content than for the content of other genres, we can go further into the analysis. This enthusiasm can potentially be due to other factors than the genre itself. By that we mean that the way the Battle Royale videos are produced may differ from the other genres which could be the cause of the enthusiasm and not only the genre itself. Potential factors that we will explore are the duration or the frequency at which the creators upload videos.

est-ce que la duration of videos is significantly different -> box plot

est-ce que la fréquence à laquelle ils upload significantly different -> box plot

if not different -> think that the genre is attractive

if different -> what is different -> could be a factor that influence the enthusiasm

to define whether the enthusiasm comes from the genre only or whe
