Now that we have analyzed how the emergence of Battle Royale impacted the gaming ecosystem of YouTube and how the creators of content reacted, we're going to focus on what happened at the viewers level. The goal is to observe whether Battle Royale genre stole aucience from other genres, or even if commenters migrated from other gaming communitites to the Battle Royale genre. In addition to that, we can ask whether the engagement dynamic of the Battle Royale community differs from other genres, and which factors influence this shift in which type of content the viewers want to consumme. In addition, it will be interesting to see if the communities of the Battle Royale games show different behaviors compared to the other genres, like more positivity/happy or more toxicity/hate.

Now we're going to focus on whether the engagement dynamics differ for Battle Royale content. More specifically, the goal is to analyze whether the new communities and the people that have started to consumme this type of content showed more engagement, or maybe less, for the videos. This can be performed by analyzing several factors as the ratio of likes per views (LPV). This ratio could indicate how implicated are the people who watch the videos. We can think of that because the viewers, that only watch the videos without liking it, could be thought to be less passionate by the content than the ones who like the videos all the time.
